# Building a CI/CD Pipeline
## Overview
This project involves building a Github repository from scratch and creating a scaffolding that will be used to perform both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for a Python-based machine learning application using the Flask web framework. It requires the use of Github Actions along with a Makefile, requirements.txt and application code to perform an initial lint, test, and install cycle. Further, the project is integrated with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.

## Instructions

### Project Architecture
Below is the architectural diag the project.

![](project-2_screen_captures/Project-2_Architecture.png)
### Creating the project repository
Setup the project repository on Github with the initial project scaffold: 
- Makefile
- Tests
- code
- requirements.txt

### Creating Azure Cloud Development Environment
- Launch an Azure Cloud Development Shell Development Environment
- create ssh-keys
- upload public ssh key to the github account hosting the project repository

### Cloning the project into Azure Cloud Shell
Below is the screenshot of the project repo cloned into the azure shell development environment.

### Updating the project scaffold and creating Python virtual environment
- Update the project files: `Makefile`, `requirements.txt` and include the project code files
- Create a Python virtual environment as follows.
    -  ```python3 -m venv ~/.myrepo```
- Activate the virtual environment by running the fowwing command.

- ```source ~/.myrepo/bin/activate```

- Create the project sript file and test files

### Performing local code test
- Test the code by running ```make all```
- A screenshot showing passing the test is shown below:

### Configure and Test GitHub Actions
Go to the Github repo and do the following:
- Enable Github Actions in the project
- Replace ```yml``` code autogenerated by enabling Github Actions with the provided ```yml```  code 
- Verify remote tests pass in Github Actions UI
as shown below:

### Continuous Delivery on Azure
Configure Azure Pipelines to deploy the [Flask starter code](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/tree/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files) to Azure App Services as follows.
- Replace scaffolding code with Flask ML code
- Run the app locally as follows:
    - activate virtual environmen by running the following code:

        - ```source ~/.myrepo/bin/activate``` followed by 
        - ```python app.py```
    - Open another cloud shell environment
        - acitvate the virtual environment and run
        - ```./make_prediction.sh```
        
        The expected output is

- Deploy the app by running
- ```az webapp up -n bostonpredictionservice```
    - here, *bostonpredictionservice* is the name of the app
- copy our the generated url: ```https://bostonpredictionservice.azurewebsites.net``` to the browser and the following message will be displayed.

- To make remote prediction: modify the project code file ```make_predict_azure_app.sh```  with your chosen app name.
- Verify prediction by running the code ```./make_predict_azure_app.sh```
- The output message is as follows:

![](project-2_screen_captures/Screenshot_azure_remote_prediction.png)

- Get log from the deployed app by running the command
```az webapp log tail``` and it displays the following output.

- Checking performance validation with ```locust```
    - modify the host name in the ```locustfile.py``` with the url of the deployed app.
    - Ensure the key names in the json under the ```predict``` function is the same as those in ```app.py```.
- Run ```locust -f locustfile.py --headless -u 20 -r 5 -t 20s```
- The expected output is

### Setting up CI/CD using 
- Go to the Azure DevOps organization in the portal
- Click on ```My Azure DeOps Organizations```
- Sign in
- Create a new project and give it a name, for e.g ```ci_cd_project2```
- Make sure that ```Git``` is selected as the version control and create
- Create a new service connection under the ```Pipelines``` tab after clicking on project settings
- choose ```Create service connection``` --> ```Azure Resource Manager``` --> ```Service principal (automatic) -->  ``` --> ```subsription``` 

- Choose ```Service connection name```

- login
- Choose the same resource group where the app is deployed
- Make sure the ```ci_cd_prGrant access permission to all pipelines is checked``` and save
- Go to ```Pieplines``` and create a new pipeline
- Choose ```Github```

- Configure the pipeline as ```Python to Linux Wepp App on Azure```
- Choose MSDN Platform Supsription and continue
- Sign in to Github 
- Choose the Project Repo in Github
- Validate and configure
- Check the package version then save and run
- The output is as follows.

### Enhancements (Future Improvement Suggestions)

Some of the ways the project can be improved in the future are:
- Ensure that all needed packages are specified in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
- Provide starter codes for deep learming frameworks such as Pytorch and TensorFlow.
